# House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.
## Overview
In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to build predictive models that estimate the price of houses. The dataset used for this task contains information about houses including their features and corresponding prices.
## Requirements
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
## Models
XGBoost Regression An optimized implementation of gradient boosting with additional regularization techniques, often known for its performance and scalability.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this house price prediction project successfully developed models to estimate house prices based on various features. The best-performing model, XGBoost Regression, achieved the lowest error and highest accuracy. Insights gained include the importance of location, size, and bedrooms in determining house prices. Future work involves refining the models and incorporating additional data for improved accuracy.
